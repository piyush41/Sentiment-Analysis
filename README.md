# Sentiment-Analysis

study the use of different pre-trained word embeddings
(word2vec/GloVe/fastText) for text representation and use them for text classification.

A simple way to represent a sentence is to tokenize, vectorize and average the word vector
representations of all the words in the sentence.

For finding please see these links to get the pre trained embeddings of the vector.

1. Word2vec (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)
2. GloVe (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
3. fastText (https://fasttext.cc/)

Use these for the refrences.
